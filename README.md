# Announcement

Sorry for being a bit inactive lately :sweat_smile: (in the Fairphone world), but anyways, I am currently learning Python and since it's a scripting language I will port my debloating script to python. It will be easier to maintain for me since I won't have to have separate versions for every OS. I can also add features like choosing to keep certain stuff, installing Aurora Store/F-Droid/Aurora Droid and even enabling the Android P theme. I already started working on it and I will post an update here when it's ready.

Stay tuned!
